# Music-Maestro
Music Maestro

Project Done in Srishti 2017

Abstract

Music Maestro is a simple human-machine interface. It’s not a robot but coded software which gives you the feel of virtual world. The basic idea for designing music maestro was to play music without actually having any instrument. We have used Xbox Kinect as our sensor to detect body movements and used Processing for our frontend interface.

Setup

Install Processing Software & Kinect SDK from internet. 
Connect kinect to your PC. Let it install the driver automatically.
Write your code on Processing and Run It!!!.

Applications

It’s very cost effective way of trying and learning various activities without even buying their requirements. As in our project we have played drums virtually, in which you can learn and play different beats according to your mood just by your hand movements in air as you are using drum sticks. Many more instruments can also be played. Just change the frontend code and you can do any activities at your home and experience it. Indirectly saying we have just hacked Xbox Kinect (which can only be used to play games) for various human activities.

Requirements

1.	Xbox Kinect (Microsoft Product)
2.	Laptop with high graphic quality (at least 4 GB Graphic card)
3.	Processing Software (Open Source software)

Libraries Used

Processing has inbuilt libraries for kinect, just download it from internet. Required libraries are:-

*	Kinect V2 for Processing - Kinect v2 implementation using the Kinect Windows SDK
*	Kinect4WinSDK - A simple wrapper for the Microsoft Kinect for Windows SDK version 1.8
*	Sound - Sound library based on MethCla for Processing. To add sound files.

These libraries have inbuilt code examples for detecting body, body depth, body joint coordinates, colour image. 

About

	Kinect uses Infrared sensors, microphone and video camera to draw exact coordinate (x,y,z) of joints of our body which is the most helpful feature. The optimum range for detection of full body joint is 2.5 to 3 meters. We can recognise voice, gesture, hand state etc.
	Processing Software was developed by MIT, just for the purpose of animation, game designing, effect designing etc. It uses basic java with inbuilt classes, methods and function for easy sketching and designing. The basic layout contain two functions i.e. setup (run once) and draw (loop).
